all dependacies needed will automatically be installed if needed. This CLI project automatically finds your downloads folder (unless its in a weird place like OneDrive) and unzips them and directs the output to "unzipped_archives" in your downloads directory then moves the original zipped files to the recycling bin then emptys it.

Works with:
  .zip
  .rar
  .tar.gz (untested)

ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS
